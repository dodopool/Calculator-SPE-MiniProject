# Calculator Project

This is a simple Java calculator, which supports following functionalities:

1. Calculating Square Root 
2. Calculating Factorial
3. Calculating Natural Log 
4. Calculating Exponentiation

## But Why? 

Well, better calculators do exist! But this calculator has been made while following DevOps principles, using the following array of tools:

1. Jenkins
2. Maven
3. Docker
4. Ansible
5. Ngrok

I used for Ngrok for exposing Jenkins's running on my localhost, so that build can be triggered automatically as and when new commits are made.

Of course, the publicly-exposed IP address is a well kept secret :D
